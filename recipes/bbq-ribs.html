    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier than it looks.
        I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night.
        The sauce is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven at 175 degrees C</li>
        <li>Cut spareribs into serving size portions</li>
    </ol>
